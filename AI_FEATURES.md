## 🚀 How It Works

### Backend Process

```
1. User Request → /api/health-insights/<user_id>
2. Fetch Data → Query SQLite for records, treatments, doctors
3. Format Data → Structure health information for AI
4. AI Analysis → Send to Google Gemini API
5. Parse Response → Extract insights from AI output
6. Return JSON → Send structured data to frontend
```

### AI Prompt Structure

```
- Health Records: Date, diagnosis, doctor, specialization
- Treatments: Medications, procedures, follow-up dates
- Doctors: Names, specializations, visit frequency
```

### Response Format

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "insights": {
    "summary": "AI-generated health overview...",
    "trends": [
      "Trend 1...",
      "Trend 2..."
    ],
    "recommendations": [
      "Recommendation 1...",
      "Recommendation 2..."
    ],
    "statistics": {
      "total_records": 10,
      "total_doctors": 3,
      "total_treatments": 5,
      "recent_visits": 2
    }
  }
}
```

---

## 🛠️ Setup Instructions

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
cd backend
pip install google-generativeai==0.3.1
```

### 2. Configure API Key

**Option A: Environment Variable (Recommended)**
```bash
export GEMINI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
```

**Option B: Direct in Code**
```python
# backend/app.py
GEMINI_API_KEY = "your-api-key-here"
```

### 3. Test the Endpoint

```bash
curl http://localhost:5000/api/health-insights/1
```

### 4. Verify Frontend

1. Start backend: `python backend/app.py`
2. Start frontend: `npm start` (in frontend directory)
3. Login and navigate to Home page
4. AI Insights appear below statistics cards

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "404 Model Not Found"
**Solution:** Update to correct model name in `backend/app.py`:
```python
GEMINI_MODELS = [
    "gemini-2.5-flash",
    "gemini-2.0-flash", 
    "gemini-2.5-pro"
]
```

### Issue: "Failed to fetch health insights"
**Check:**
1. Backend server running on port 5000
2. CORS enabled in Flask app
3. API key valid and not expired
4. Network connectivity

### Issue: "Insights not displaying"
**Debug:**
1. Open browser console (F12)
2. Check for JavaScript errors
3. Verify API response in Network tab
4. Check user_id is being passed correctly

### Issue: "Slow response time"
**Solutions:**
- Switch to gemini-2.5-flash (fastest model)
- Reduce data sent to AI (limit records)
- Add request timeout handling
- Implement caching for repeated requests
